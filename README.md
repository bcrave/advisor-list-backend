# Advisor List Backend

This is the backend for the [advisor list](https://github.com/bcrave/advisor-list-frontend) project I did in React with TypeScript and Tailwind.  
It's just a basic REST API without a proper database, just a JSON file that I imported into the main app.

## To run the app
- Clone this repo.
- Run `npm install` to get all the used dependencies.
- You may need to run `tsc` to get the TypeScript compiler set up.
- Run `npm run dev` to spin up the server.  It will be running by default on port `5000`.
